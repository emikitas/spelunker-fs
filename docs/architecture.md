# Roadmap

1. CLI.
2. List 1 directory w/ flat output.
3. Traverse over a directory hierarchy.
4. Use a thread pool to traverse the FS.
5. Benchmarks.
6. Filter by file type.
7. Filter file/directory name with regex.
7. Turn the interface with the FS async (perhaps with io-uring?).
8. Different output formats (some graph represantaion?).
